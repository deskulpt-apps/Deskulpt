We are excited to announce the release of Deskulpt v0.2.0! You can download it from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/deskulpt-apps/Deskulpt/releases/tag/v0.2.0). For an exhaustive list of changes, please refer to the "Full Changelog" section of the [release notes](https://github.com/deskulpt-apps/Deskulpt/releases/tag/v0.2.0).

## No More Manual Switching Between "Sink" and "Float" Modes

One of the most confusing concepts of Deskulpt was the distinction between "Sink" and "Float" modes. Users had to manually switch between these two modes depending on whether they wanted to interact with the desktop or the widgets.

In this new release, Deskulpt has a new **"Auto" mode** that eliminates the need for such manual switching. In "Auto" mode, the canvas window will automatically sink when the your mouse cursor is not hovering over any widget, allowing you to interact with the desktop.

This behavior is automatically turned on when you upgrade to v0.2.0. If you like the old behavior, you can still switch back to "Sink" or "Float" modes under the "Settings" tab in the manager interface. Note that on macOS, "Auto" mode requires [Input Monitoring](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/control-access-to-input-monitoring-on-mac-mchl4cedafb6/mac) permission so that Deskulpt can detect the mouse cursor position. It will prompt you to grant that permission on first launch after the upgrade.

The shortcut used to toggle between "Sink" and "Float" modes still works in this new release, but only when you are not in "Auto" mode.

Note that this "Auto" mode feature is still actively being improved, and we welcome any feedback you may have! If you encounter any bugs or have any suggestions, please let us know by opening an issue on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/deskulpt-apps/Deskulpt/issues).

## System Tray Left-Click Behavior

Previously, left-clicking the system tray icon would switch between "Sink" and "Float" interaction modes, which was not intuitive especially for new users. In this release, left-clicking the system tray icon will open the manager interface instead.

Also, you can no longer switch between "Sink" and "Float" modes from the system tray. Instead, either use the "Auto" mode, or go to the "Settings" tab in the manager interface, or register a custom shortcut for that.

## Disambiguate Refresh Behavior

The refresh behavior for widgets was confusing in the previous version of Deskulpt. In particular, the global "Refresh current widgets" button does not detect additions/removals of widgets or changes in manifest files `deskulpt.widget.json`. Similarly, the per-widget "Refresh this widget" button does not detect changes in the manifest file either. One must use the global "Rescan widgets directory" action instead which is counter-intuitive.

In this release, the global "Refresh current widgets" and "Rescan widgets directory" buttons have been merged into a single "Refresh all widgets" button that is capable of detecting all kinds of changes in the widgets directory and will render them accordingly on the canvas. The per-widget "Refresh this widget" button has been updated to detect changes in the manifest file as well.

## Better Settings Persistence

Settings were persisted only at application shutdown. If there are unexpected crashes or forced quits, settings changes may be lost. In this release, settings are persisted on change, reducing the risk of losing settings changes.

## Fix Shortcut Registration on macOS

Fixed the problem that shortcut registration was not working on macOS in previous version.
