# First Launch

When you launch Deskulpt for the first time, go to your desktop and you should see a **welcome widget** displayed on the screen. This widget provides quick access to essential resources to help you get started with Deskulpt.

Hover over the widget to reveal the drag handle. You can click and drag the widget to reposition it anywhere on your desktop. Hover near the edges of the widget to resize it as needed.

:::warning
For macOS users, Deskulpt might request the [Input Monitoring](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/control-access-to-input-monitoring-on-mac-mchl4cedafb6/mac) permissions. This is in order that Deskulpt can properly detect mouse movements on the desktop canvas to ensure correct interaction with the widgets. Please enable this permission in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Input Monitoring, and [restart Deskulpt](#exiting-deskulpt) for the changes to take effect.

## System Tray

Deskulpt runs in the background and can be accessed from the system tray. Find the Deskulpt icon in your system tray and left-click to open the manager interface. For Linux users, right-click the icon and click "Manage" in the menu instead. The manager interface will be described in detail in the next sections. Right-clicking the tray icon will reveal more quick actions.

## Exiting Deskulpt

Note that closing the manager interface will not exit Deskulpt. To fully exit Deskulpt, right-click the system tray icon and select "Exit".
