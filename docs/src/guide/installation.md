## ⚠️ Security Warning: Malware Risks

**IMPORTANT: Installing widgets from untrusted sources can pose serious security risks to your system.**

### Understanding the Risks

When you download widgets as zip files from third-party sources or unknown developers, you are potentially exposing your system to:

- **Malware and Viruses**: Malicious code that can harm your computer, steal data, or compromise system security
- **Spyware**: Software that monitors your activities and collects personal information
- **Ransomware**: Malicious programs that can encrypt your files and demand payment
- **Backdoors**: Unauthorized access points that allow attackers to control your system

### Best Practices for Safe Widget Installation

To protect yourself and your system:

1. **Only Download from Trusted Sources**
   - Use the official Deskulpt Widget Gallery whenever possible
   - Only download from verified developers or official repositories
   - Check widget ratings, reviews, and download counts

2. **Verify the Source**
   - Review the developer's reputation and history
   - Check for official website or GitHub repository
   - Look for community feedback and security audits

3. **Scan Before Installing**
   - Run downloaded zip files through antivirus software before extraction
   - Use your operating system's built-in security scanning tools
   - Be cautious of widgets that request excessive permissions

4. **Keep Your System Protected**
   - Maintain up-to-date antivirus software
   - Enable your operating system's security features
   - Regularly update Deskulpt to the latest version for security patches

5. **Warning Signs of Malicious Widgets**
   - Widget source is unknown or suspicious
   - Unusual file sizes or file types within the zip
   - Requests for unnecessary system permissions
   - Poor or no documentation
   - Spelling errors or unprofessional presentation

### Reporting Security Issues

If you encounter a suspicious widget or potential security threat:

- Report it immediately through our [Security Issue Form](https://github.com/yourusername/Deskulpt/security)
- Do not share the malicious file with others
- Delete the widget and run a full system scan

**Remember: When in doubt, don't install it. Your system security is more important than any widget.**
