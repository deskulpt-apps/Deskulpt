## Disambiguate Refresh Behavior

The refresh behavior for widgets was confusing in the previous version of Deskulpt. In particular, the global "Refresh current widgets" button does not detect additions/removals of widgets or changes in manifest files `deskulpt.widget.json`. Similarly, the per-widget "Refresh this widget" button does not detect changes in the manifest file either. One must use the global "Rescan widgets directory" action instead which is counter-intuitive.

In this release, the global "Refresh current widgets" and "Rescan widgets directory" buttons have been merged into a single "Refresh all widgets" button that is capable of detecting all kinds of changes in the widgets directory and will render them accordingly on the canvas. The per-widget "Refresh this widget" button has been updated to detect changes in the manifest file as well.
